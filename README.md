We welcome contributions to this open-source SiteBuilder Theme based on Creative Tim's brilliant SoftUI Design System. 

If you'd like to contribute to the main Siteglide Theme Module, the master branch is protected, so for new contributions, please create a new branch and create a pull request containing the changes you'd like to make. Don't forget to also update the changelog with what you have changed- list your new version number as "pending".

If you'd like to build your own version of the module entirely, please create a fork and register as your own Module in the Siteglide Marketplace.

Please make sure your contributions only contain content which is your own, or is open source. A pro version of this module will be created for content which requires a license to use.
